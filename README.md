# React practice

practice useState

###### there is a problem.we can not pass data from down to top,we pass data from top to bottom.

###### so,when we add items,it's impossible to send data in top.so we send it parents component,then parent component share it.

# implement deleting

##### when i clicked delete button one items will delete,thats easy,but i need to click in an item,then this item will go item list,then delete it,so i need to set function on parents components
